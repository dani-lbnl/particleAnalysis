# Particle Analysis

## Goals
- make code available to support particle analysis from images
- particle is any object that can be recovered as a connected component
- do the work, independently of the favor
- be loyal to the solution, not to a particular tool
- use free software, so that others can leverage

## Modules

### Data reduction
- initial estimation of the zones most likely to contain the regions of interest (ROI)
- user-guided, semi-automated and automated methods for determining ROIs
- 

### Mechanical turk
- GUIs for curating data
- typical motifs in curation processes
- "joystaking"/gamefied ways of having domain experts to curate data for the code developers

### Segmentation methods

### Links to data repositories used in developing these modules
- because you need to understand without reading every line of code
- because you need to reproduce before you change the code
- because you do not want to reinvent the wheel.
